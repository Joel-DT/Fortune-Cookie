# Fortune-Cookie
A small and simple JavaFX Fortune Cookie App
<hr>
A small project to practice some JavaFX by creating a Fortune Cookie App that displays fortunes read from a text file. 
There are 42 fortunes that are shuffled once they are read into the app. Whenever a cookie is opened, by pressing the cookie-button, the image changes to an opened cookie and one fortune is displayed below. 
Each fortune displayed is removed from the list, in order never to duplicate a fortune. A new-cookie-button is enabled permitting the user to acquire a new fortune cookie.<br>
When all fortunes are consumed all buttons are disabled, virtually stopping the program.
