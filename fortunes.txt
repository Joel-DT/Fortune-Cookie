No snowflake #in an avalanche #ever feels responsible.
About time I got out #of that cookie. :)
Ignore previous cookie.
In youth and beauty, #wisdom is rare.
Ask not #what your fortune cookie #can do for you, #but what you can do #for your fortune cookie.
The fortune you seek is #in another cookie...
I see money #in your future, #it is not yours though.
Right there #in front of you: #All the darkness #in the world!
Three can keep a secret, #if you get rid of two.
You broke my tiny home. #You Bastard!
This cookie is…. #never gona give you up, #never gona let you down.
Error 404: #Fortune not fund.
Catch on fire #with enthusiasm #and people will #come for miles #to watch you burn.
Be kind to pigeons, #a statue might someday #be made of yourself.
An old friend #is better #than two new friends.
Comfort zones are #most often expanded #through discomfort.
Fortune not found: #Abort, Retry, Ignore?
If your cookie #is in 2 pieces #the answer is yes.
Pull your head #out of your ass, #and life #won't be so shitty.
If you need viagra, #you're probably with #the wrong girl.
Be cautious #while walking #in darkness alone.
If you are the #smartest person #in the room, #then you are #in the wrong room.
Wait, be patient... #eventually, #you’ll love your partner.
When working #towards a solution #to a problem, #it always helps #if you know the answer.
It could be better, #but it is good enough.
Only the wisest and #stupidest of men #never change.
Do or do not, #there is no try!
Special touches #have been planned #with you in mind.
Before you receive, #you must give.
Bend the rod #while it is still hot.
Constant grinding #can turn an iron rod #into a needle.
The nature of #war and love #is constant change.
Every exit #is an entrance #to new experiences.
Open up your mind, #let your fantasies unwind.
The end is near! #And it is all your fault!
Never forget: #Your tongue #is your ambassador.
Science is not #a sacred cow. #Science is a horse. #Don't worship it. #Feed it!
After all, #it is only the mediocre #who are always #at their best.
Three women #and a goose #make a market.
A man is judged by #the company he keeps.
- think big. #- keep it simple. #- search for the pattern.
Don't be afraid #of being unique, #it's like being afraid #of your best self.
